     JPython is the same langiage but implemented using Java

2. python2:
     a. when two integers are divided, we get interger value
     b. to store unicode string value, we need to defime them with "u"
     c. the xrange() is used for iterations
     d. it should be enclosed in notations
   
   python3:
     a. when two integers are divided, we get a float value
    b.default storing of string is unicode
     c. range() function is used
    d. enclosed in paranthesis

3. ASCII- 
     a. it uses 8-bit encoding
     b. ascii represents 128 characters
    c. it is stored as 8 byte
    d.  not standardized

    Unicode-
     a. variable bit encoding
      b. defines 2^21 characters
     c. stored in byte sequences such as UTF-32 and UTF-8
     d.  standardized
